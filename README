Run script/cmailpro_troubleshooter_server.pl to test the application.

== Installation ==

Untar the archive with the source code:

  tar -xjf cMailPro-TroubleShooter-git-master.tar.bz2

Copy the extracted directory somewhere. For example

 mkdir /srv/cmailprpots/
 cp -a cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master /srv/cmailprots/

 or

 mkdir /home/cmailprots
 cp -a cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master /home/cmailprots

Change the permissions of the files, so the web server can access
them.

 chown www-data:www-data -R  /home/cmailprots/cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master

 or

 chown apache:apache -R  /home/cmailprots/cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master

Go to the CommuniGate server admin interface, and under "Users ->
Skins" upload the WCGP wrapper cmailpro_ts_api.wcgp. This file is
located in the communigate_helpers/wcgp directory.

In the CommuniGate admin interface go to "Settings -> Services ->
HTTPU" and under "CGI Applications" set the CGI Directory to the
appropriate location, if it is not already set. For example:

 /var/CommuniGate/cgi


From the communigate_helpers/cgi directory in the source code tree,
copy the cmailpro_ts_api.cgi file to the CommuniGate server in the
configured directory for CGI Applications. Set the executable flag of
the script. For example

 scp cmailpro_ts_api.cgi user@communi.gate.ip:/var/CommuniGate/cgi
 user@communi.gate.ip:# chmod +x /var/CommuniGate/cgi/cmailpro_ts_api.cgi

If necessary edit the CGI file and change directories:

   our $queue_dir = "/var/CommuniGate/Queue/";
   our $logs_dir = "/var/CommuniGate/SystemLogs/";

Edit the config file cmailpro_troubleshooter.conf:

 emacs /home/cmailprots/cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master/cmailpro_troubleshooter.conf

 or

 vi /home/cmailprots/cMailPro-Troubleshooter-git-master/cmailpro_troubleshooter.conf

Set the CommuniGate connection settings in the
<Model::CommuniGate::CLI> section. For example:

 <Model::CommuniGate::CLI>
    PeerAddr  192.168.19.22
    PeerPort  106
    SecureLogin 1
    login  user
    password user_password
 </Model::CommuniGate::CLI>

The PeerAddr is the IP address of the CommuniGate server.

Set the helper CGI script credentials in the
<Model::CommuniGate::cMailProTSAPI> section.

For example:
 <Model::CommuniGate::cMailProTSAPI>
    username  user
    password user_password
    verify_ssl 1
    url   https://192.168.19.22:9100/sys/cmailpro_ts_api.wcgp
 </Model::CommuniGate::CLI>

The URL option is the URL to the WCGP wrapper already installed on the
CommuniGate server.

NOTE: If the server DOES NOT HAVE PROPER SSL CERTIFICATE, set
verify_ssl to -1 and set the url protocol to http and the port to
8100. For example:

 <Model::CommuniGate::cMailProTSAPI>
    username  user
    password user_password
    verify_ssl -1
    url   http://192.168.19.22:8100/sys/cmailpro_ts_api.wcgp
 </Model::CommuniGate::CLI>

 THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. BETTER CONFIGURE YOUR SERVER CERTIFICATE.


Apache with mod_perl deployment

Copy the apache_mod_perl_cmailpro-ts.conf file from the deployment
directory to the Apache web server config directory. For example

  cp deployment/apache_mod_perl_cmailpro-ts.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/ # Debian

  or

  cp deployment/apache_mod_perl_cmailpro-ts.conf /etc/httpd/conf/ # CentOS

Edit that file and set the paths in the following lines to match the
paths where the source code was copied:

  PerlSwitches -I/home/cmailpro-ts/cMailPro-TroubleShooter/lib
  DocumentRoot /home/cmailpro-ts/cMailPro-TroubleShooter/root

If not using Apache HTTP Authorization, remove the following lines:

   AuthType Basic
   AuthName "cMailPro TroubleShooter Login"
   # (Following line optional)
   AuthBasicProvider file
   AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/htpasswords/cmailprots
   Require valid-user

If you are using Apache HTTP Authorization, set the appropriate path
for the AuthUserFile setting, create the file and a user. For example:

  htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/htpasswords/cmailpro user

Restart the web server

 service apache2 restart

 or

 service httpd restart
